# NREGA-Analysis
### Overview
This project delves into the analysis of data related to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 
(NREGA), a transformative government scheme to provide rural households with guaranteed 
wage employment opportunities. The dataset used for this analysis encompasses many 
parameters, including the number of job cards issued, the workforce engaged, budget allocation, work 
completion statistics, and much more. Through data analytics techniques, we aim to 
gain valuable insights into the implementation and impact of NREGA across different states and districts 
in India.
### Problem Statement
NREGA is a vital initiative to alleviate rural unemployment and poverty. This project seeks to address 
several key questions and challenges associated with NREGA:
- How effective is NREGA in providing employment opportunities to rural households?
- Are there regional disparities in the implementation and outcomes of the scheme?
- What is the utilization of the allocated budget, and how does it correlate with 
  employment generation?
- What are the key factors contributing to the completion of NREGA works, and are there 
  any roadblocks to its success?
- Can data-driven insights guide policymakers and administrators in optimizing the 
  scheme's impact?
