# NREGA-Analysis
## Problem Statement
**Abstract:**
This project delves into the analysis of data related to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 
(NREGA), a transformative government scheme aimed at providing rural households with guaranteed 
wage employment opportunities. The dataset used for this analysis encompasses a wide range of 
parameters, including the number of job cards issued, the workforce engaged, budget allocation, work 
completion statistics, and much more. Through the application of data analytics techniques, we aim to 
gain valuable insights into the implementation and impact of NREGA across different states and districts 
in India.<br>
**Problem Statement:** 
NREGA is a vital initiative to alleviate rural unemployment and poverty. This project seeks to address 
several key questions and challenges associated with NREGA:
- How effective is NREGA in providing employment opportunities to rural households?
- Are there regional disparities in the implementation and outcomes of the scheme?
- What is the utilization of the allocated budget, and how does it correlate with 
employment generation?
- What are the key factors contributing to the completion of NREGA works, and are there 
any roadblocks to its success?
- Can data-driven insights guide policymakers and administrators in optimizing the 
scheme's impact?<br>
**Dataset Information:**
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from official government records and contains information 
related to NREGA implementation across various states and districts in India. It comprises 28 columns, 
encompassing data on job cards, worker details, budget allocation, work completion statistics,
expenditure, and more. This dataset offers a comprehensive view of the progress and challenges faced 
by the NREGA program.<br>
